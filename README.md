## My process

After been practicing with a few other challenges, this one was pretty easy and fun to do! I'm proud that i did it in a short amount of time compared to the other ones, and just spend the rest trying to reduce and optimize the css file.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge helped me to practicing the fundamentals, my semantic HTML, and a lot more. Gaining confidence after solve a challenge even when it's easy always boosts up the mood! :) 

### Continued development

I'd like to change the responsive to change the image to the side, instead of just the background. Similar to the "product-preview-card-component" just to practice even more the responsive design.
